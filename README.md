# CitySim
**Project is NOT yet finished. Expected to be by the end of 2012** 

CitySim is a City Traffic Simulator package that can be imported into any 3D game that is looking to implement a Traffic System. Its goal is to minimize the amount of time that a developer would normally spend on creating an AI Vehicle System. It also highly focuses on optimization so that the package does not affect the performance of the main game.
